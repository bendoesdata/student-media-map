This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## GitHub Actions & Deployment

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated deployment to Netlify:

- **Automatic Deploy:** Every time you push to the `main` branch, a Netlify build process is triggered.

### How it works

1. The workflow installs dependencies and builds the project using Vite.
2. The build output (`dist` folder) is automatically deployed by Netlify.
3. No manual deployment steps are neededâ€”just push to `main`!

You can find the workflow file at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

## Recommended IDE Setup
